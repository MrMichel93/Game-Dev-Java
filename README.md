# Java Game Development - AP CS A Aligned Course

An engaging introduction to Java programming and Object-Oriented Programming through game development, specifically designed to prepare students for the AP Computer Science A exam.

## 🎮 Course Overview

This course uses **game development as a vehicle** to teach rigorous OOP principles while following the AP CS A curriculum sequence. Students ages 17-20 will learn Java by building games, making abstract concepts concrete and engaging.

## 🎯 Course Philosophy

- **From Procedural to Object-Oriented:** Systematic transition from basic variables to complex class hierarchies
- **Games as Learning Tools:** Every concept illustrated with game examples
- **AP Exam Focused:** Direct alignment with AP CS A Units 1-10
- **Hands-On Practice:** Every lesson includes coding labs and practice problems

## 📚 Course Structure

### Unit 1: Primitive Types (Game State Fundamentals)
Learn how variables store game state (score, health, position) using int, double, and boolean types.

### Unit 2: Using Objects (Introducing Game Entities)  
Work with pre-existing classes, create Sprite objects, and understand object references.

### Unit 3: Boolean Expressions and if Statements (Game Logic)
Implement collision detection, win/lose conditions, and AI decision-making.

### Unit 4: Iteration (Game Loops and Updates)
Master loops for game updates, animating multiple entities, and processing collections.

### Unit 5: Writing Classes (Complete Game Entities)
Design Player, Enemy, and Projectile classes with proper encapsulation.

### Unit 6: Array (Managing Entity Collections)
Use arrays for grid-based levels, high score tables, and fixed entity counts.

### Unit 7: ArrayList (Dynamic Entity Management)
Implement dynamic enemy spawning and projectile systems with ArrayLists.

### Unit 8: 2D Array (Grid-Based Games)
Create tile maps, board games, and level layouts using 2D arrays.

### Unit 9: Inheritance (Enemy Hierarchies)
Build enemy type hierarchies (Enemy → Boss, Enemy → Minion) with inheritance.

### Unit 10: Recursion (Advanced Algorithms)
Apply recursion to pathfinding, flood fill, and procedural generation.
