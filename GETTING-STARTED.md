# Getting Started with Java Game Development

Welcome to the Java Game Development course! This guide will help you get started quickly.

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Check Prerequisites
- Java installed? Run `java -version` in terminal
- If not installed, see [SETUP.md](SETUP.md)

### Step 2: Choose Your First Lesson
**Recommended starting point:** [Unit 1, Lesson 1: Variables and Game State](Unit01-Primitive-Types/lessons/Lesson1-Variables-GameState.md)

### Step 3: Run Your First Example

```bash
cd Unit01-Primitive-Types/code-examples
javac ScoreTracker.java
java ScoreTracker
```

You should see a score tracking simulation!

### Step 4: Try Your First Problem
Open `Unit01-Primitive-Types/practice-problems/Problem1_HealthSystem.java` and implement the health system methods.

## 📖 Learning Path

### Week 1: Foundations
- ✅ Complete [SETUP.md](SETUP.md)
- ✅ Read [Unit 1 Lesson](Unit01-Primitive-Types/lessons/Lesson1-Variables-GameState.md)
- ✅ Solve all 3 Unit 1 practice problems
- ✅ Build the Stat Display Panel project

### Week 2-3: Objects and Logic
- Units 2-3 (content coming soon)
- Focus: Using objects, boolean logic, conditionals

### Week 4-5: Classes and Collections
- Units 4-6
- Focus: Loops, writing classes, arrays

### Week 6-8: Advanced OOP
- Units 7-9
- Focus: ArrayList, 2D arrays, inheritance

### Week 9-10: Mastery
- Unit 10 + Review
- Focus: Recursion, practice FRQs

## 🎯 What You'll Build

By the end of this course, you'll have built:

1. **Stat Display System** (Unit 1) - Track game statistics
2. **Player Class** (Unit 5) - Complete character with combat
3. **Enemy Hierarchy** (Unit 9) - Multiple enemy types with inheritance
4. **And more!** - Each unit has a project

## 💡 Study Tips

### For Success:
1. **Don't skip practice problems** - They're where learning happens
2. **Type code yourself** - Don't just read, code along
3. **Experiment** - Modify examples to see what changes
4. **Compare with Python** - If you know Python, use the comparisons
5. **Test frequently** - Compile and run code often

### When Stuck:
1. Review the lesson
2. Check the code examples
3. Look at the solution (but try first!)
4. Re-read the AP Exam Tips section

## 🆘 Need Help?

### Common Issues:

**"Java not found"**
- Install JDK (see SETUP.md)
- Add to PATH environment variable

**"Class not found"**
- Make sure you're in the right directory
- Check spelling of class name

**"Cannot find symbol"**
- Check variable/method spelling
- Verify imports if using external libraries

## 🎮 Have Fun!

Remember: You're learning serious computer science through game development. Every game you build is demonstrating important programming concepts that appear on the AP exam.

**Ready?** Open [Unit 1, Lesson 1](Unit01-Primitive-Types/lessons/Lesson1-Variables-GameState.md) and start coding!
