# Java Game Development Course - AP CS A Aligned

## Course Overview

This course uses game development as a vehicle to teach rigorous Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in preparation for the AP Computer Science A Exam. Students will learn Java programming through building engaging game projects while mastering the core concepts tested on the AP exam.

**Target Audience:** Students ages 17-20 preparing for AP CS A

**Tech Stack:** Java with Processing (Java mode) or LibGDX

## Course Philosophy

This course helps students transition from **procedural thinking** to **object-oriented design** by:
- Using games as practical, engaging examples of OOP concepts
- Emphasizing class design, inheritance, and polymorphism through game entities
- Applying data structures to manage game state and collections of objects
- Connecting every concept directly to AP CS A exam requirements

## Course Structure

The course follows the official AP CS A unit sequence, ensuring complete exam coverage:

### Unit 1: Primitive Types (Game State Fundamentals)
- **Focus:** Variables, data types, and operators in game context
- **Game Concepts:** Score tracking, player stats, position coordinates
- **OOP Foundation:** Understanding state vs. behavior

### Unit 2: Using Objects (Introducing Game Entities)
- **Focus:** Object instantiation, method calls, String manipulation
- **Game Concepts:** Sprite objects, game window setup, coordinate systems
- **OOP Foundation:** Objects as game entities

### Unit 3: Boolean Expressions and if Statements (Game Logic)
- **Focus:** Conditional logic, boolean algebra, control flow
- **Game Concepts:** Collision detection, win/lose conditions, AI decisions
- **OOP Foundation:** Object state queries and comparisons

### Unit 4: Iteration (Game Loops and Updates)
- **Focus:** while loops, for loops, nested iteration
- **Game Concepts:** Game loop, updating multiple entities, animation frames
- **OOP Foundation:** Processing collections of objects

### Unit 5: Writing Classes (Complete Game Entities)
- **Focus:** Class design, encapsulation, constructors, methods
- **Game Concepts:** Player class, Enemy class, Projectile class
- **OOP Foundation:** **Encapsulation** (private vs public members)

### Unit 6: Array (Managing Entity Collections)
- **Focus:** Array declaration, traversal, and algorithms
- **Game Concepts:** Grid-based levels, fixed entity counts, high scores
- **OOP Foundation:** Homogeneous collections of objects

### Unit 7: ArrayList (Dynamic Entity Management)
- **Focus:** ArrayList operations, wrapper classes
- **Game Concepts:** Dynamic enemy spawning, projectile systems
- **OOP Foundation:** **Polymorphism** (storing different types in one list)

### Unit 8: 2D Array (Grid-Based Games)
- **Focus:** 2D array traversal, row-major vs column-major
- **Game Concepts:** Tile maps, board games, level layouts
- **OOP Foundation:** Nested object structures

### Unit 9: Inheritance (Enemy Hierarchies)
- **Focus:** Inheritance, method overriding, super keyword
- **Game Concepts:** Enemy types (Enemy → Boss, Enemy → Minion)
- **OOP Foundation:** **Inheritance** and **Polymorphism** in practice

### Unit 10: Recursion (Advanced Algorithms)
- **Focus:** Recursive thinking, base cases, recursive cases
- **Game Concepts:** Pathfinding, flood fill, procedural generation
- **OOP Foundation:** Recursive object traversal

## Learning Components

Each lesson includes:

1. **Learning Objective:** Clear, AP-aligned goal
2. **Class Design Exercise:** Define game-related classes
3. **OOP Principle Deep Dive:** Encapsulation, Inheritance, or Polymorphism
4. **Coding Lab:** Hands-on implementation of specific Java methods
5. **AP Exam Tip:** How the concept appears in FRQs
6. **Python Concept Note:** Brief comparison for students with Python background
7. **Practice Problems:** 3 problems mixing code writing, debugging, and enhancement
8. **Project Task:** Build a specific game feature

## AP Exam Connection

This course prepares students for both sections of the AP CS A exam:
- **Multiple Choice:** Conceptual understanding reinforced through game examples
- **Free Response Questions (FRQs):** Class design, array/ArrayList manipulation, inheritance hierarchies

Each unit includes specific "AP Exam Tips" highlighting how concepts typically appear on the exam.

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (variables, loops, conditionals)
- Algebra I (for coordinate math and game physics)
- No prior Java experience required

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. Design and implement complete Java classes with proper encapsulation
2. Create class hierarchies using inheritance and polymorphism
3. Manage collections of objects using arrays and ArrayLists
4. Apply OOP principles to solve complex problems
5. Confidently approach AP CS A exam questions
6. Build complete, functional games demonstrating OOP mastery

## Course Navigation

Each unit folder contains:
- `lessons/` - Detailed lesson plans with learning objectives
- `practice-problems/` - Three problems per major concept
- `projects/` - Cumulative project tasks
- `code-examples/` - Working Java code demonstrating concepts

Start with Unit 1 and progress sequentially through Unit 10.
